OBJECT:
An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior.
An Object is an instance of a Class. 

DECLARING A FUNCTION OUTSIDE CLASS:
return_type class_name::function_name()

COPY CONSTRUCTOR:
A Copy Constructor creates a new object, which is an exact copy of the existing object. 
The compiler provides a default Copy Constructor to all the classes.

IMPORTANT:
Why do we give semicolons at the end of class?
Many people might say that itâ€™s a basic syntax and we should give a semicolon at the end of the class as 
its rule defines in cpp. But the main reason why semi-colons are there at the end of the class is compiler checks 
if the user is trying to create an instance of the class at the end of it. Yes just like structure and union, we can also 
create the instance of a class at the end just before the semicolon. As a result, once execution reaches at that line,
it creates a class and allocates memory to your instance.


ENCAPSULATION leads to data hiding
POLYMORPHISM is implemented in INHERITANCE
DYNAMIC BINDING IS IMPLEMENTED USING VIRTUAL FUNCTION MAKING IT A PART OF RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM
ACCESS SPECIFIERS ARE USED TO IMPLEMENT DATA hiding

FRIEND CLASS
A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend.
For example, a LinkedList class may be allowed to access private members of Node
 EXPLAINATION: a linked list can be a class and the node values can be from another class .  so if the linked list is declared as a friend class to another class, it can access the node values which will be useful to manipulate the LL

FRIEND CLASS:
friend return_type function_name(arguments)
