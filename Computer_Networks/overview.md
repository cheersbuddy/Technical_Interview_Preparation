#Topics
Not a huge amount of time will be spent here, but you do need to know basics of subjects like Operating Systems, Databases, OOPs, Algorithms and sometimes Computer Networks.
#prepare short notes:

Databases: 10-15 days
Operating System: 8-10 days
Computer Networks: 15-20 days (Unfortunate that not all companies ask it, but it's lengthy)
OOPs: 5-10 days (Don't just read and make notes, but also practice some LLDs. This will prepare you for both computer fundamentals and system design)
Data Structures and Algorithms[DSA]: No need to dedicate separate time. Your coding practice will be enough.

#coding platforms
 Codechef and Codeforces
 LeetCode
 InterviewBit[IB]

 Note: Get comfortable with Strings, Dynamic Programming and Graphs. The toughest questions are from these 3 topics and hence expect atleast 1 question from these topics in the online round.
